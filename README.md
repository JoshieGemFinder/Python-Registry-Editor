# Python-Registry-Editor
Python registry editor I'm working on

Only works on Windows

Requires python 3.x to be installed, no extra modules are needed though
(You can even use the microsoft store version)

Open by double-clicking reg.py, there's instructions there

Currently allows you to:

View keys and values  
Set values  
Create values

Currently is console-based, that might change in the future
